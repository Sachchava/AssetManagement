# Asset Management System with User Access Control and Sensor Data Visualization

Welcome to the Asset Management System repository. This system is designed to help administrators manage assets, control user access, and visualize sensor data for assets. Below are some key highlights and information about the project.

## Key Project Highlights

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Developed using .NET Core for API development.
- **Frontend:** Built with React.js for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Database:** Utilized SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for secure and efficient storage and retrieval of asset and sensor data.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive line graphs are generated using Plot.js for enhanced data visualization and analysis.

### Robust Access Control
- Implemented user-specific asset visibility.
- Administrators have the authority to grant or deny access to specific assets for individual users.
- Enhanced data security by ensuring that users can only access assets they are explicitly granted access to.

### Efficient CRUD Operations
- Comprehensive system for performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on assets.
- Streamlined asset management processes, improving efficiency and productivity.

### Interactive Data Visualization
- Utilized Plot.js to create dynamic line graphs for sensor data visualization.
- Users can easily analyze asset data through interactive and informative charts.
